PyBer_Analysis ##OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS The overview for this project was to learn how to use the python based coding and jupyter notebook to utilize matplotlib plit charts. this includes bar charts, time series, pie charts, and histograms. we also analyzed the data and used merging to combine the data and look at newly created data frames together. we learned to create matplotlib charts and save them as files, as well as how to save a datafram to a new csv or a new .xlsx file. reading and writing to excel as well as saving .pngs using coding.

PYBER analyiss included an alysis or driver fares in dirrent cities and urban areas. we looked at finanical data such as fares and total drives and total fares. we looked at number of rides and geographical data. we also analyzed based on time periods.The purpose was ultimatly to make sense of the city_data and the ride data csv giles.

###Results the following key metrics were calcualted and a datafram was made so that we could see differences between rides, drivers, fares, average fare per ride, and average fees paid to the driver. you can see these images in the .iypnb file as well as the analysis file image

you can make a number of conclusions about profitablitliy and timing based on this data set.

###Summary this analysis reuslts is creating metrics and charts based on the data set and addressing the disparities among the services our drivers provide. Urban cities have higher fares and thus we should try to focus the most on these areas since they are important and the best for generating fares as well as helping the drivers earn more money, driving driver retension we cannot neglect the rural and subburna opproutnies though, where there is still substantial room for growth.
