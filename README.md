##OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS 
The overview for this project was to learn how to use the python based coding and jupyter notebook to utilize matplotlib plit charts. this includes bar charts, time series, pie charts, and histograms. we also analyzed the data and used merging to combine the data and look at newly created data frames together. we learned to create matplotlib charts and save them as files, as well as how to save a datafram to a new csv or a new .xlsx file. reading and writing to excel as well as saving .pngs using coding. 

PYBER analyiss included an alysis or driver fares in dirrent cities and urban areas. we looked at finanical data such as fares and total drives and total fares. we looked at number of rides and geographical data. we also analyzed based on time periods.The purpose was ultimatly to make sense of the city_data and the ride data csv giles. 
###Results
the following key metrics were calcualted and a datafram was made so that we could see differences between rides, drivers, fares, average fare per ride, and average fees paid to the driver. you can see these images in the .iypnb file as well as the analysis file
